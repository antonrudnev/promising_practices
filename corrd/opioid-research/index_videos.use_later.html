                <h2>
                    Introducing the CORRD
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Welcome to the Community Opioid Research and Response Dashboard (CORRD). The CORRD is a resource
                    for coalitions, task forces, and others seeking ways to address the opioid crisis in their
                    community. The CORRD serves as a starting place for those on this journey. AIR has brought together
                    programs from across sectors and geographies to enable users to explore emerging solutions
                    alongside supporting research, recommendations, and community examples. The CORRD is best used with
                    our Community Data Interpretation methodology, through which expert facilitators guide participants
                    in using and interpreting the content in this resource.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nationally, the opioid crisis is a major public health threat, yet the factors driving the epidemic
                    may differ by community. Communities can benefit from choosing programs that address their unique
                    needs while involving individuals and groups who want to be part of the solution, such as anti-drug
                    coalitions, advocates, pharmacists, public health practitioners, criminal justice officials, and
                    others. To achieve this goal, the CORRD enables users to filter programs by stakeholders involved
                    in program implementation, the populations they serve, and the goal of the program. Users also can
                    do a scan to learn about the kinds of programs that communities like theirs have implemented by
                    applying filters for geographic region (urban or rural) and state.

                    <h2>How AIR Built the Tool</h2>
                    <p>
                        Unlike other resources such as clearinghouses that present only a limited number of
                        evidence-based interventions, AIR took a more comprehensive approach to creating this tool.
                        CORRD gives users the opportunity to see which communities implemented the intervention, the
                        outcomes of research studies, and sources recommending use of the intervention. This extra
                        information empowers users to assess whether an intervention may be a good fit for their
                        community.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To build the tool, AIR’s team of health researchers searched peer-reviewed literature, reports,
                        clearinghouses, anti-drug coalition websites, and many other resources to identify information
                        and evaluations on interventions related to opioid response efforts. Researchers then tagged
                        each entry on several dimensions including stakeholder groups who implemented the intervention,
                        the goal of the intervention, its components, the location of implementation, the population(s)
                        included in the program, and whether it was tailored for a specific racial or ethnic group.
                        Based on these characteristics, entries were grouped under one of seven intervention categories
                        described at the bottom of this page.

                    <p>How can information in the CORRD help you identify solutions that may be right for your
                        community? The CORRD includes different types of evidence for each intervention – from research
                        studies to expert recommendations. Many things need to be considered when assessing an
                        intervention – including research study type, location, and how many people participated. It is
                        also important to consider the experiences of communities who implemented the intervention. The
                        CORRD is a starting place for understanding the types of evidence available for each
                        intervention, and the results. The CDC’s “Understanding Evidence Part 1: Best Available
                        Research Evidence. A Guide to the Continuum of Evidence of Effectiveness” is an excellent <a
                            href="https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/understanding_evidence-a.pdf" target="_blank">resource</a>
                        for learning more about interpreting evidence. AIR can work with you to assess the evidence
                        base to determine which interventions may be effective for your community.

                                        Some interventions have been implemented in many communities, recommended in
                                        several reports, and researched extensively. This can mean the intervention has
                                        been well tested, and more likely to be effective than those with fewer
                                        entries. Consider using the filters to narrow the entries to your stakeholder

                                        Our team tagged the stakeholders already involved in implementing the programs
                                        on the CORRD. If your stakeholder group is not represented, this may be an
                                        opportunity for your group to create new cross sector partnerships. Identify
                                        programs that might be a good fit for your community and begin thinking of ways
                                        your stakeholder group could become involved. AIR has decades of experience
                                        bringing cross sector groups together to plan and implement programs. Contact

                                        help rural regions. These interventions need to be tailored to meet the unique

                                    As opioid addiction and overdose have risen to epidemic proportions, a multifaceted
                                    public health approach that uses primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention
                                    strategies is needed to scale efforts to reduce overprescribing of opioids and
                                    unlawful opioid use.<sup>1</sup> Prevention strategies can integrate educational
                                    programs and social marketing campaigns designed to counteract drivers of misuse,
                                    including increased opioid prescribing by providers and misperceptions about the
                                    risks associated with prescription opioids. Thirty-seven states have an
                                    opioid-specific public education campaign.<sup>2</sup> Such a public health
                                    approach directly counters some of the large-scale educational campaigns that
                                    pharmaceutical companies used to encourage the prescription of opioids for pain
                                    relief. Increasing awareness of the risks associated with opioid use among both the
                                    public and prescribers is an important step in addressing the opioid crisis.
                                    Addressing the stigma associated with opioid use disorder (OUD) that often keeps
                                    people from seeking treatment is another important educational initiative that is
                                    needed to help professionals and the public understand OUD as a chronic illness.<sup>3</sup></p>

                                    Community-based prevention programs have community advisory boards and invite
                                    active participation by community drug coalitions to facilitate multipronged
                                    educational strategies in curbing the use of opioids and preventing opioid
                                    overdose.<sup>4</sup> While it is challenging to demonstrate the effectiveness of
                                    certain preventive and educational initiatives when they often co-occur during
                                    public health campaigns, these initiatives collectively show promise.</p>

                                <p>The widespread availability and overprescribing of opioids have been a driving force
                                    of the opioid epidemic in many regions.<sup>1</sup> Almost 70 percent of opioids
                                    prescribed after surgery go unused, creating a reservoir of prescription opioids
                                    for misuse.<sup>9</sup> Having unused opioids in the home poses a threat to the
                                    larger community, because research has shown that the majority of people who report
                                    using opioids for non-medical purposes got the opioids from a friend or family
                                    member for free.<sup>10</sup> Four out of five people using heroin report that they
                                    started using opioids with a prescription opioid, though not necessarily an opioid
                                    prescribed to them.<sup>11</sup></p>

                                <p>To lower the potential for misuse and diversion (that is, transfer of a legally
                                    prescribed drug from the person who got the prescription to another person for
                                    illegal use), safe prescribing strategies to curb the excess supply of prescription
                                    opioids include the following: limitations on the number of pills in an initial
                                    opioid prescription, establishing prescription drug monitoring programs, offering
                                    or mandating prescriber education on pain management and appropriate opioid
                                    prescribing, and safe disposal of unused opioids. The effectiveness of safe
                                    prescribing policies varies based on the scope and intensity of programs in
                                    different regions and among patient groups.<sup>2</sup> Certain providers and
                                    patients may resist such limitations to protect appropriate and individualized
                                    treatment plans for pain management. Policies for safer prescribing of opioids also
                                    include training providers on opioid alternatives for pain management and
                                    appropriate means of identifying people at risk for OUD.<sup>12</sup> Safe
                                    prescribing strategies are aimed at reducing the volume of opioids prescribed to
                                    lower the incidence of OUD and to reduce the risk of overdose among those who use
                                    opioids.</p>

                                    to death. Between 2001 and 2013, heroin overdose deaths increased fivefold, and
                                    prescription opioid deaths increased threefold. Fentanyl is a very strong synthetic
                                    opioid that can be prescribed for pain, but it is increasingly being produced
                                    illegally and sold in the illicit drug market. In recent years, fentanyl has
                                    contributed to a growing percentage of opioid overdose deaths because of its high
                                    potency and the unpredictable drug market in many places. Opioid overdose can cause

                                    effective in reversing opioid overdoses and saving lives. These programs have not
                                    been shown to increase drug use and have been shown to increase treatment for OUD.
                                    Groups with high rates of opioid overdose, such as individuals leaving the prison
                                    system, are often given prioritized access to naloxone.<sup>32</sup> Other
                                    harm-reduction strategies include “safe consumption sites”<sup>33</sup> where
                                    people with OUD are provided with safe, clean environments for injecting opioids in
                                    a monitored setting that also offers a variety of other services, including links
                                    to treatment options and social services programs. Safety policies can also include
                                    “syringe service programs” (SSPs), which focus on preventing adverse health
                                    consequences such as skin infections and transmission of infectious diseases such
                                    as HIV and hepatitis C.</p>

                                <p>Access to all forms of treatment, including treatments that use medication and those
                                    that use psychosocial therapy, is limited in many regions of the country,
                                    especially in rural areas. Different health insurers and Medicaid programs in
                                    different states may cover different types of services, or they may have very small
                                    networks of available providers. Alternative and integrated treatment delivery
                                    models can address such systemic barriers to treatment delivery.<sup>22</sup></p>
                                <p>Vermont’s integrated hub-and-spoke treatment network is an example of a successful
                                    treatment delivery model to expand OUD treatment capacity and services.<sup>23</sup>
                                    The model developed new opioid treatment programs (that is, programs that provide
                                    methadone maintenance treatment) as well as an integrated treatment delivery
                                    system. Opioid treatment programs exist in five regions of the state and act as
                                    “hubs,” with specialized addiction-related services. “Spokes” are community-based
                                    providers, often primary care providers, who offer ongoing buprenorphine and
                                    injectable naltrexone medication management to patients who need a lower level of
                                    support or higher level of stability in their recovery. Patients are able to be
                                    assessed in the hub clinics and can be referred to spokes when appropriate. If a
                                    patient needs more specialized care in the future, they can be referred back to the
                                    hub as needed. Similar models to connect silos of care, and to integrate
                                    office-based opioid treatment with OTPs, have been adopted in Baltimore.<sup>24</sup></p>
                                <p>Some opioid treatment models use computer-based interventions through the internet
                                    and telephones. Helplines linking people to local treatment resources, 24/7
                                    callback support, and emergency overdose responses have been effective in
                                    motivating treatment and abstinence.<sup>25</sup> Telemedicine/telehealth
                                    interventions use a variety of telecommunication technologies for treatment
                                    delivery as well as for education, counseling, peer support, and monitoring. These
                                    kinds of interventions reduce patient concerns about confidentiality and are
                                    associated with participant enthusiasm.<sup>26</sup> They also can increase
                                    availability of information, education of OUD patients and their families, and
                                    effective treatment for OUD at lower costs.<sup>27</sup></p>
                                <p>Project ECHO, a distance education model that connects specialists with primary care
                                    providers through teleconference for case-based learning and mentoring, has been
                                    used to educate providers on evaluation and treatment of substance use disorders.<sup>28</sup>
                                    The project also includes a teleECHO clinic that recruits doctors to participate in
                                    buprenorphine waiver trainings. This model is not for actual treatment using
                                    technology but, rather, for providing training and support for practicing
                                    providers.</p>

                                    State policies and laws enable widespread implementation of opioid prevention and
                                    treatment strategies and can remove barriers to treatment and other needed
                                    services. For instance, the enactment of mental health parity laws and
                                    comprehensive insurance coverage policies and procedures could affect access and
                                    use of substances and mental health treatment.<sup>34</sup> Currently, all 50
                                    states have naloxone access laws that give laypersons access to naloxone. Good
                                    Samaritan laws in 41 states give legal protections to individuals who report an
                                    opioid overdose. Both naloxone access laws and Good Samaritan laws have been
                                    effective in reducing opioid-related deaths.<sup>35,36</sup> Strategies to prevent
                                    and reduce opioid-related harms in individuals prosecuted for drug-related offenses
                                    are also important.</p>

                                    Drug courts and diversion programs can be effective in reducing recidivism<sup>37,38</sup>
                                    and exist in 39 states as alternatives to the traditional criminal justice system
                                    response to nonviolent, drug-related offenses. Drug courts require regular
                                    monitoring of people in diversion programs, which can offer education and
                                    employment opportunities. Diversion programs can take many forms, offering a path
                                    to treatment over punitive measures. Law enforcement officers can use such programs
                                    to divert people to treatment and other services including housing, mental health,
                                    or job training as an alternative to arrest.<sup>39</sup> For instance, Seattle’s
                                    Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) program has been associated with reduced
                                    recidivism and improved housing, employment, and community integration outcomes.<sup>40,41</sup>
                                    Employment programs that are integrated with treatment can be effective in opioid
                                    treatment retention, recovery, and abstinence.<sup>19,20</sup></p>

                                <p>Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) is an effective strategy to treat opioid use
                                    disorder (OUD).<sup>14</sup> Methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone are three
                                    medications that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved for treating
                                    OUD and reducing risk of relapse. Federal regulation mandates that methadone for
                                    opioid addiction can be dispensed only in licensed methadone treatment programs
                                    (called “opioid treatment programs,” or OTPs). Methadone maintenance has a large
                                    evidence base and has been available for over 40 years. It is considered by many to
                                    be the gold standard for OUD treatment and also has been shown to be effective in
                                    pregnant women with OUD.<sup>15</sup></p>
                                <p>Buprenorphine can be prescribed from office-based settings (primary care or other
                                    types of outpatient practices) by medical providers who have completed additional
                                    education and obtained a waiver from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)
                                    allowing them to prescribe buprenorphine for treatment of OUD. When prescribed at
                                    higher doses, buprenorphine maintenance has been shown to have similar outcomes to
                                    methadone maintenance.<sup>16</sup></p>
                                <p>Although oral naltrexone is available and approved for treatment of OUD, studies
                                    have not shown that oral naltrexone is effective in treating OUD, and it is
                                    generally not recommended. Injectable naltrexone has been shown to be effective for
                                    OUD and can be prescribed by any physician, nurse practitioner, or physician
                                    assistant with prescribing privileges. Injectable naltrexone has been shown to
                                    reduce illegal opioid use and increase retention in treatment compared to people
                                    receiving no medication. Only methadone and buprenorphine have been associated with
                                    reduced death rates.<sup>13</sup></p>
                                <p>Because OUD is a chronic condition, some people may need to use medication for long
                                    periods of time; others may need to use it for the rest of their lives, similar to
                                    the way many people with high blood pressure or type 2 diabetes take medications
                                    throughout their lives to manage their conditions. People who take medications for
                                    longer periods of time are less likely to relapse. The decision to taper or stop a
                                    medication should be made between a patient and their medical provider.</p>
                                <p>The MAT approved for OUD is recommended for use with psychosocial therapy, though
                                    medications should not be withheld if a person is not ready for or willing to start
                                    psychosocial treatments, or if these services are not immediately available.
                                    Integrating medical management with psychosocial approaches is a comprehensive way
                                    to address opioid addiction and maintain abstinence in OUD treatment.</p>
                                <p>Besides being an effective strategy to treat OUD, some forms of MAT have been found
                                    to improve other outcomes, such as reducing HIV transmission, lowering recidivism
                                    (reoffending behaviors) in the criminal justice system, and reducing opioid
                                    overdose.<sup>14</sup> But access to MAT is not widespread, and efforts to increase
                                    access are often limited by regulatory challenges and community resistance to the
                                    opening of addiction treatment programs (sometimes referred to as NIMBY—“not in my
                                    back yard”). MAT may be unavailable due to cost, lack of providers, community
                                    concerns about diversion, and stigma associated with MAT.<sup>17</sup></p>

                                <p>Psychosocial therapy is a way of modifying the thought and action processes that
                                    become impaired during active addiction. Psychosocial therapy also helps patients
                                    cope with social and emotional problems that may be associated with OUD. An array
                                    of behavioral approaches exists to help patients control the urge to use opioids
                                    and to help them develop new coping mechanisms. The therapies and strategies listed
                                    below can be used with medication or as stand-alone services.</p>
                                <p><strong>Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT)</strong> enables participants to develop
                                    skills that can foster abstinence but may also be used to tackle co-occurring
                                    psychiatric and emotional problems. CBT has been shown to be effective in achieving
                                    long-term abstinence.<sup>18</sup></p>
                                <p><strong>Contingency management (CM)</strong> interventions offer incentives or
                                    rewards that are contingent on negative toxicology screening (drug tests showing no
                                    recent drug use) to encourage continued abstinence.<sup>18</sup> These incentives
                                    can be monetary or non-monetary, such as employment.<sup>19,20</sup> The success of
                                    CM interventions shows that positive incentives in substance use treatment are more
                                    effective than negative consequences (such as restricting the use of methadone in
                                    an opioid treatment program). CM interventions have the lowest dropout rates
                                    compared to other cognitive behavioral approaches.<sup>21</sup></p>
                                <p><strong>Relapse prevention</strong> helps people in recovery identify and avoid
                                    high-risk situations that may lead to the use of opioids or other drugs. In relapse
                                    prevention, providers practice alternative coping mechanisms that can be used
                                    during periods of stress or strong cravings with participants. Such approaches have
                                    been successful in increasing post-treatment abstinence.<sup>21</sup> Individuals
                                    can also be treated in the context of their family and social systems, by engaging
                                    their social networks in <strong>group or family treatments</strong>. These
                                    approaches apply a variety of techniques including communication training, skills
                                    training, abstinence contracts, and the cooperation of non-opioid-using partners.
                                    Modifications to family treatments include multisystemic therapy, brief strategic
                                    family therapy, and multidimensional therapy, which can be tailored to individual
                                    needs, social circumstances, and age groups.</p>
                                <p>Patients who receive psychosocial therapies have better outcomes than patients who
                                    do not.<sup>21</sup> Patients who receive medication along with therapy have better
                                    outcomes than those who receive psychosocial therapies alone. Current guidelines
                                    suggest that all patients receiving medication should be offered psychosocial
                                    therapy, but it should not be required for the person to receive the medication.<sup>13</sup>
                                    Because OUD is a chronic condition, many individuals will engage in psychosocial
                                    treatment for prolonged periods of time. Many people will have periods in their
                                    lives when they need more or less behavioral counseling, and like other chronic
                                    conditions, the level of services should rely on the patient’s symptoms and needs
                                    at the time.</p>
