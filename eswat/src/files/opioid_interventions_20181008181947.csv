1,Prevention Point Pittsburgh Overdose Prevention Program,Layperson Training in Administration of Naloxone,"Abstract: ""Prevention Point Pittsburgh (PPP) is a public health advocacy organization that operates Allegheny County's only needle exchange program. In 2002, PPP implemented an Overdose Prevention Program (OPP) in response to an increase in heroin-related and opioid-related overdose fatalities in the region. In 2005, the OPP augmented overdose prevention and response trainings to include naloxone training and prescription. The objective of our study is to describe the experiences of 426 individuals who participated in the OPP between July 1, 2005, and December 31, 2008. Of these 249 overdose episodes in which naloxone was administered, participants reported 96% were reversed. The data support findings from a growing body of research on similar programs in other cities. Community-based OPPs that equip drug users with skills to identify and respond to an overdose and prescribe naloxone can help users and their peers prevent and reverse potentially fatal overdoses without significant adverse consequences.""

2,At-Home Drug Disposal Pouch,Drug Disposal Programs,"Abstract: ""This paper reports the results of an at-home environmentally safe, convenient, and effective drug disposal system in the form of a carbon-based drug deactivation pouch. Deactivation started immediately after addition of the medications into the disposal pouches. Within 8 h, around 47%, 70% and 97% of diazepam, lorazepam and buprenorphine were adsorbed by the activated carbon, respectively. By the end of 28 days, over 99% of all drugs were deactivated. Context: The improper disposal of unused prescription opioids has a potential for abuse as well as environmental contamination. Consequently, there is an imperative need for an environmentally safe, convenient, and effective drug disposal system. Objective: The objective of this study is to analyze the deactivation efficiency of the disposal system employing four model opioid drugs of high abuse potential Methods: The deactivation system used in this investigation is an activated granular carbon based disposal system in the form of a pouch, which can be used to safely and effectively deactivate unused or expired medications. HPLC method validation for each drug was performed prior to analyzing drug content in the deactivation study. Opioid drugs in different dosage forms were added to individual pouches in the presence of warm water. Pouches were shaken and sealed, then stored at room temperature. The deactivation efficiency of the system was tested by collecting samples at different time points up to 28-d. Results: An average of 98.72% of medications were adsorbed by activated carbon within 8-h and continued to do so over time. At the end of the 28-d study, more than 99.99% of all drugs were deactivated. In the desorption study, almost no drug leached out from the activated carbon in larger volume of water and less than 1.3% leached out on extraction with ethanol. Conclusion: This unique drug disposal system successfully adsorbed and deactivated the model opioid medications by the end of 28-d, offering a safe and convenient route of disposal of unused or residual opioid drugs.""","Abstract: ""This paper reports the results of an at-home environmentally safe, convenient, and effective drug disposal system in the form of a carbon-based drug deactivation pouch.

3,Buprenorphine Taper Duration,Medication Assisted Treatment Related Programs & Policies,"Abstract: ""A double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter randomized controlled trial where youth participants were assigned behavioral counseling, abstinence incentives, and buprenorphine for either 28 days or 56 days. The goal of this intervention was to determine if the length of the intervention effected abstinence and treatment retention. It was found that the longer (56-day) buprenorphine taper produces better opioid abstinence and retention outcomes than shorter (28-day) buprenorphine taper for opioid-dependent youth. Those in the 56-day treatment had significantly more opioid negative urine samples than the 28-day group (35% vs 17%, p=.039, Cohen's d=0.57, 95% CI: 0.02,1.13) and stayed in the treatment significantly longer  (37.5 vs 26.4 days, p=.027, Cohen's d=0.63, 95% CI: 0.06, 1.19). Background and Aims: Few randomized controlled trials have evaluated buprenorphine treatment interventions for opioid-dependent youth. Consequently, optimal administration strategies for this cohort are unclear. Our aim was to evaluate the relative efficacy of two different buprenorphine taper lengths in promoting abstinence from illicit opioids and treatment retention among opioidâdependent youth. Design: A double-blind, placebo controlled, multicenter randomized controlled trial. Setting: Two hospital-based research clinics (Manhattan and Brooklyn) in New York City, USA from 2005 to 2010. Participants: Volunteer sample of 53 primarily Caucasian participants between the ages of 16 and 24 (n = 11 under age 18) who met DSMâIV opioid dependence criteria. Intervention: Participants were assigned randomly to either a 28-day buprenorphine taper (n = 28) or 56-day buprenorphine taper (n = 25) via a parallel-groups design during a 63-day period. Both groups received behavioral counseling and opioid abstinence incentives. Both taper conditions had a minimum of 1 week of placebo dosing at the end of the taper. Measurements: The primary outcome was opioid abstinence measured as a percentage of scheduled urine toxicology tests documented to be negative for opioids. The secondary outcome was treatment retention, measured as number of days attended scheduled visits. Findings: Intent-to-treat analyses revealed that participants who received a 56-day buprenorphine taper had a significantly higher percentage of opioid-negative scheduled urine tests compared with participants who received a 28-day buprenorphine taper [35 versus 17%,P = 0.039, Cohen's d = 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.02, 1.13]. Participants who received a 56-day buprenorphine taper were retained in treatment significantly longer than participants who received a 28-day buprenorphine taper (37.5 versus 26.4 days, P = 0.027, Cohen's d = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.06, 1.19).

Objective: To test whether the Communities That Care (CTC) prevention system reduced levels of risk and adolescent problem behaviors community wide 8 years after implementation of CTC. Design, Setting, and Participants: A community-randomized trial was performed in 24 small towns in 7 states, matched within state, assigned randomly to a control or intervention group in 2003. All fifth-grade students attending public schools in study communities in 2003-2004 who received consent from their parents to participate (76.4% of the eligible population) were included. A panel of 4407 fifth graders was surveyed through 12th grade, with 92.5% of the sample participating at the last follow-up. Interventions: A coalition of community stakeholders received training and technical assistance to install CTC, used epidemiologic data to identify elevated risk factors and depressed protective factors for adolescent problem behaviors in the community, and implemented tested and effective programs for youths aged 10 to 14 years as well as their families and schools to address their community’s elevated risks. Main Outcomes and Measures: Levels of targeted risk; sustained abstinence, and cumulative incidence by grade 12; and current prevalence of tobacco, alcohol, and other drug use, delinquency, and violence in 12th grade. Results: By spring of 12th grade, students in CTC communities were more likely than students in control communities to have abstained from any drug use (adjusted risk ratio [ARR] = 1.32; 95% CI, 1.06-1.63), drinking alcohol (ARR = 1.31; 95% CI, 1.09-1.58), smoking cigarettes (ARR = 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.27), and engaging in delinquency (ARR = 1.18; 95% CI, 1.03-1.36).

Interventions to prevent overdose risk behaviors among high-risk patients are lacking. This study examined the impact of a motivational intervention to reduce opioid misuse and overdose risk behaviors. Methods: This study was a pilot randomized controlled trial set in a single emergency department (ED) in which, 204 adult, English-speaking patients seeking care who reported prescription opioid misuse during the prior 3 months were recruited. Patients were randomized to either the intervention, a 30-minute motivational interviewing-based session delivered by a therapist plus educational enhanced usual care (EUC), or EUC alone. Participants completed self-reported surveys at baseline and 6 months post-baseline (87% retention rate) to measure the primary outcomes of overdose risk behaviors and the secondary outcome of non-medical opioid use. Findings: Participants in the intervention condition reported significantly lower levels of overdose risk behaviors (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.59 - 0.87, 40.5% reduction in mean vs. 14.7%) and lower levels of non-medical opioid use (IRR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.70 - 0.92, 50.0% reduction in mean vs. 39.5%) at follow-up compared to the EUC condition.

Design and participants: Ten individuals, divided equally between those trained or not trained in overdose recognition and response, were recruited from each of six sites (n=62). Setting: US‐based overdose training and naloxone distribution programs in Baltimore, San Francisco, Chicago, New York and New Mexico. Measurements: Participants completed a brief questionnaire on overdose knowledge that included the task of rating 16 putative overdose scenarios for: (i) whether an overdose was occurring and (ii) if naloxone was indicated. Bivariate and multivariable analyses compared results for those trained to untrained. Responses were also compared to those of 11 medical experts using weighted and unweighted kappa statistics. Findings: Respondents were primarily male (72.6%); 45.8% had experienced an overdose and 72% had ever witnessed an overdose. Trained participants recognized more opioid overdose scenarios accurately (t60=3.76, P<0.001) and instances where naloxone was indicated (t59=2.2, P<0.05) than did untrained participants.

Method: A cohort sequential design included 28 public school districts randomly assigned to the partnership delivery system or usual-programming conditions. At baseline, 11,960 students participated. Partnerships supported community teams that implemented a family-focused intervention in 6th grade and a school-based intervention in 7th grade. Outcome measures included lifetime, current misuse, and frequencies of misuse, for a range of substances. Intent-to-treat, multilevel analyses of covariance of point-in-time misuse and analyses of growth in misuse were conducted. Results: Results showed significantly lower substance misuse in the intervention group at one or both time points for most outcomes, with relative reduction rates of up to 31.4%. There was significantly slower growth in misuse in the intervention group for 8 of the 10 outcomes. In addition, risk moderation results indicated that there were significantly greater intervention benefits for higher- versus lower-risk youth, for the misuse of 6 of the 10 substances at 11th grade, illicit substances at 12th grade, and growth in the misuse of illicit substances. Conclusion: Partnership-based delivery systems for brief universal interventions have potential for public health impact by reducing substance misuse among youth, particularly higher-risk youth.""
""The current study examines longer-term effects of this partnership-based prevention program delivery model. The three tiers of the PROSPER model consist of: (1) teams of community stakeholders linked with public schools and led by local CES staff, (2) Prevention Coordinators (PCs) connected with the land grant university's CES, and (3) a team of state-level university researchers and CES faculty. This prevention program utilizes family-focused interventions as well as school-based interventions. The Strengthening Families Program: For Parents and Youth 10-14 (SFP: 10â14) program was selected for the family intervention. School-based EBIs were: Life Skills Training, Project Alert and All Stars.

Method: A cohort sequential design included 28 public school districts randomly assigned to the partnership delivery system or usual-programming conditions. At baseline, 11,960 students participated. Partnerships supported community teams that implemented a family-focused intervention in 6th grade and a school-based intervention in 7th grade. Outcome measures included lifetime, current misuse, and frequencies of misuse, for a range of substances. Intent-to-treat, multilevel analyses of covariance of point-in-time misuse and analyses of growth in misuse were conducted. Results: Results showed significantly lower substance misuse in the intervention group at one or both time points for most outcomes, with relative reduction rates of up to 31.4%. There was significantly slower growth in misuse in the intervention group for 8 of the 10 outcomes. In addition, risk moderation results indicated that there were significantly greater intervention benefits for higher- versus lower-risk youth, for the misuse of 6 of the 10 substances at 11th grade, illicit substances at 12th grade, and growth in the misuse of illicit substances. Conclusion: Partnership-based delivery systems for brief universal interventions have potential for public health impact by reducing substance misuse among youth, particularly higher-risk youth.""
""The current study examines longer-term effects of this partnership-based prevention program delivery model. The three tiers of the PROSPER model consist of: (1) teams of community stakeholders linked with public schools and led by local CES staff, (2) Prevention Coordinators (PCs) connected with the land grant university's CES, and (3) a team of state-level university researchers and CES faculty. This prevention program utilizes family-focused interventions as well as school-based interventions. The Strengthening Families Program: For Parents and Youth 10-14 (SFP: 10â14) program was selected for the family intervention. School-based EBIs were: Life Skills Training, Project Alert and All Stars.

Design, Setting, and Participants: A randomized clinical trial involving 329 opioid-dependent patients who were treated at an urban teaching hospital ED from April 7, 2009, through June 25, 2013. Interventions: After screening, 104 patients were randomized to the referral group, 111 to the brief intervention group, and 114 to the buprenorphine treatment group. Main Outcomes and Measures: Enrollment in and receiving addiction treatment 30 days after randomization was the primary outcome. Self-reported days of illicit opioid use, urine testing for illicit opioids, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk, and use of addiction treatment services were the secondary outcomes. Results: Seventy-eight percent of patients in the buprenorphine group (89 of 114 [95% CI, 70%-85%]) vs 37% in the referral group (38 of 102 [95% CI, 28%-47%]) and 45% in the brief intervention group (50 of 111 [95% CI, 36%-54%]) were engaged in addiction treatment on the 30th day after randomization (Pâ<â.001). The buprenorphine group reduced the number of days of illicit opioid use per week from 5.4 days (95% CI, 5.1-5.7) to 0.9 days (95% CI, 0.5-1.3) vs a reduction from 5.4 days (95% CI, 5.1-5.7) to 2.3 days (95% CI, 1.7-3.0) in the referral group and from 5.6 days (95% CI, 5.3-5.9) to 2.4 days (95% CI, 1.8-3.0) in the brief intervention group (P<.001 for both time and intervention effects, P=.02 for the interaction effect).

For the entire population, significant reductions were found by the time of delivery for illicit (P < .001) and prescription opioids (P = .001), cocaine (P < .001), marijuana (P = .009), and alcohol use (P < .001).

38,Medicaid Controlled Substance Lock-In Program,Lock-In Programs,"Abstract: ""Opioid misuse, abuse, and overdose are a rapidly growing public health epidemic. Medicaid Lock-In Programs (MLIPs) are designed to prevent overutilization of controlled substances by Medicaid patients. However, despite widespread use, there is little information on their effect. Using North Carolina (NC) Medicaid claims data from October 2008 through June 2013, we examined changes in Medicaid-reimbursed opioid prescriptions by patients enrolled in NC's MLIP. We used mixed effects models to examine the effect of MLIP enrollment on monthly opioid claims, number of pharmacies, total days' supply, total units (ie, pills), and total Medicaid payments for opioids. In our sample of 6,148 MLIP patients, the odds of having any opioid claim in a given month was 84% lower during MLIP enrollment relative to the period before enrollment (odds ratio = .16). MLIP enrollment also corresponded with a reduction in monthly number of opioid prescriptions by 1.13, monthly number of pharmacies by .61, and monthly Medicaid expenditures by $22.78. Although MLIPs may constitute a successful component of comprehensive efforts to reduce the potential overutilization of opioids, care should be taken to ensure that programs such as MLIPs do not constrain patients' legitimate needs for analgesic medications. Perspective: Enrollment in NC's MLIP reduced the likelihood that patients would present a claim for an opioid prescription, and the number of opioid prescriptions patients secured each month. MLIPs may constitute a successful strategy for reducing the misuse, abuse, and diversion of prescription opioids. However, further research is needed to examine the program's potential unintended consequences.""

We aimed to estimate the difference in opioid relapse-free survival between XR-NTX and BUP-NX. Methods: We initiated this 24 week, open-label, randomised controlled, comparative effectiveness trial at eight US community-based inpatient services and followed up participants as outpatients. Participants were 18 years or older, had Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 opioid use disorder, and had used non-prescribed opioids in the past 30 days. We stratified participants by treatment site and opioid use severity and used a web-based permuted block design with random equally weighted block sizes of four and six for randomisation (1:1) to receive XR-NTX or BUP-NX. XR-NTX was monthly intramuscular injections (Vivitrol; Alkermes) and BUP-NX was daily self-administered buprenorphine-naloxone sublingual film (Suboxone; Indivior). The primary outcome was opioid relapse-free survival during 24 weeks of outpatient treatment. Relapse was 4 consecutive weeks of any non-study opioid use by urine toxicology or self-report, or 7 consecutive days of self-reported use. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02032433. Findings: Between Jan 30, 2014, and May 25, 2016, we randomly assigned 570 participants to receive XR-NTX (n=283) or BUP-NX (n=287). The last follow-up visit was Jan 31, 2017. As expected, XR-NTX had a substantial induction hurdle: fewer participants successfully initiated XR-NTX (204 [72%] of 283) than BUP-NX (270 [94%] of 287; p<0·0001). Among all participants who were randomly assigned (intention-to-treat population, n=570) 24 week relapse events were greater for XR-NTX (185 [65%] of 283) than for BUP-NX (163 [57%] of 287; hazard ratio [HR] 1·36, 95% CI 1·10–1·68), most or all of this difference accounted for by early relapse in nearly all (70 [89%] of 79) XR-NTX induction failures. Among participants successfully inducted (per-protocol population, n=474), 24 week relapse events were similar across study groups (p=0·44). Opioid-negative urine samples (p<0·0001) and opioid-abstinent days (p<0·0001) favoured BUP-NX compared with XR-NTX among the intention-to-treat population, but were similar across study groups among the per-protocol population. Self-reported opioid craving was initially less with XR-NTX than with BUP-NX (p=0·0012), then converged by week 24 (p=0·20). With the exception of mild-to-moderate XR-NTX injection site reactions, treatment-emergent adverse events including overdose did not differ between treatment groups. Five fatal overdoses occurred (two in the XR-NTX group and three in the BUP-NX group). Interpretation: In this population it is more difficult to initiate patients to XR-NTX than BUP-NX, and this negatively affected overall relapse.

We aimed to assess the efficacy, safety, and patient-reported outcomes of an injectable, once monthly extended-release formulation of the opioid antagonist naltrexone (XR-NTX) for treatment of patients with opioid dependence after detoxification. Methods: We did a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, 24-week trial of patients with opioid dependence disorder. Patients aged 18 years or over who had 30 days or less of inpatient detoxification and 7 days or more off all opioids were enrolled at 13 clinical sites in Russia. We randomly assigned patients (1:1) to either 380 mg XR-NTX or placebo by an interactive voice response system, stratified by site and gender in a centralised, permuted-block method. Participants also received 12 biweekly counselling sessions. Participants, investigators, staff, and the sponsor were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was the response profile for confirmed abstinence during weeks 5–24, assessed by urine drug tests and self report of non-use. Secondary endpoints were self-reported opioid-free days, opioid craving scores, number of days of retention, and relapse to physiological opioid dependence. Analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00678418. Findings: Between July 3, 2008, and Oct 5, 2009, 250 patients were randomly assigned to XR-NTX (n=126) or placebo (n=124). The median proportion of weeks of confirmed abstinence was 90·0% (95% CI 69·9–92·4) in the XR-NTX group compared with 35·0% (11·4–63·8) in the placebo group (p=0·0002). Patients in the XR-NTX group self-reported a median of 99·2% (range 89·1–99·4) opioid-free days compared with 60·4% (46·2–94·0) for the placebo group (p=0·0004). The mean change in craving was −10·1 (95% CI −12·3 to −7·8) in the XR-NTX group compared with 0·7 (−3·1 to 4·4) in the placebo group (p<0·0001). Median retention was over 168 days in the XR-NTX group compared with 96 days (95% CI 63–165) in the placebo group (p=0·0042). Naloxone challenge confirmed relapse to physiological opioid dependence in 17 patients in the placebo group compared with one in the XR-NTX group (p<0·0001). XR-NTX was well tolerated. Two patients in each group discontinued owing to adverse events. No XR-NTX-treated patients died, overdosed, or discontinued owing to severe adverse events. Interpretation: XR-NTX represents a new treatment option that is distinct from opioid agonist maintenance treatment.

The 2011 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) demonstrated that 1 in 20 persons in the US aged 12 or older reported nonmedical use of prescription painkillers in the past year. Prescription drug overdose is now the leading cause of accidental death in the United States – surpassing motor vehicle accidents. Great efforts have been initiated to curb the overdose crisis. Notable examples of these efforts are (1) the Drug Enforcement Administration’s (DEA) National Take-Back Initiative instituted in 2010; (2) the Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) implemented in most US states to provide practitioners with point-of-care information regarding a patient’s controlled substance use; (3) the naloxone rescue programs initiated in the community to avert mortality resulting from overdose. The use of naloxone rescue strategies has gained traction as an effective measure to prevent fatal opioid overdose. Many US federal-government agencies are working to make these strategies more accessible to first responders and community participants. This new approach faces many challenges, such as accessibility to naloxone and the equipment and training needed to administer it, but none is more challenging than the fear of legal repercussions. US federal-government agencies, local governments, health care institutions, and community-based organizations have begun to tackle these barriers, and naloxone take-home programs have gained recognition as a feasible and sensible preventive strategy to avoid a fatal result from opioid overdose. Although many challenges still need to be overcome, it is important for federal government research agencies to initiate and support independent and rigorous evaluation of these programs to inform policymakers how effective these programs can be to save lives and curb the opioid overdose public health crisis...The paper provides an overview of the challenges and opportunities encountered by efforts in community naloxone programs to distribute naloxone and train in its use to reverse opioid overdose and prevent death.""

The conclusions is that ""federal programs could potentially support more comprehensive take-home naloxone programs. Federal funding for research to provide evidence in support of easily administered naloxone formulations and effective approaches to distribute naloxone in the community would aid consideration by regulatory agencies such as the FDA to change the availability of naloxone. This line of research is critical to educate policymakers to provide funding and to change the laws. Training and education could then be funded, to support the dissemination of these findings and advance the use of these lifesaving measures. The practice of using naloxone rescue to combat fatality in overdose could be further advanced by providing reimbursement for overdose prevention and specific response education, naloxone prescription and delivery devices, and incentives for providers to adopt these measures more broadly.

Training and education could then be funded, to support the dissemination of these findings and advance the use of these lifesaving measures. The practice of using naloxone rescue to combat fatality in overdose could be further advanced by providing reimbursement for overdose prevention and specific response education, naloxone prescription and delivery devices, and incentives for providers to adopt these measures more broadly. Public awareness campaigns aimed at wide dissemination of Medication Assisted Treatment information about risk factors, signs and symptoms, and effective response to overdose could then be initiated.""

In addition, the ED has the potential to equip patients with nasal naloxone kits as part of this effort. We evaluated the feasibility of an ED-based overdose prevention program and described the overdose risk knowledge, opioid use, overdoses, and overdose responses among participants who received overdose education and naloxone rescue kits (OEN) and participants who received overdose education only (OE). Methods: Program participants were surveyed by telephone after their ED visit about their substance use, overdose risk knowledge, history of witnessed and personal overdoses, and actions in a witnessed overdose including use of naloxone. Results: A total of 415 ED patients received OE or OEN between January 1, 2011 and February 28, 2012. Among those, 51 (12%) completed the survey; 37 (73%) of those received a naloxone kit, and 14 (27%) received OE only. Past 30-day opioid use was reported by 35% OEN and 36% OE, and an overdose was reported by 19% OEN and 29% OE.

The pre-intervention, intervention, and post-intervention periods were: July 2010–June 2011, July 2011–September 2011, and October 2011–September 2012. High-risk prescribers were those in the top 5th percentile of opioid volume during four consecutive calendar quarters.

Results: We identified 1526 (4.0%) high-risk prescribers in Florida, accounting for 67% of total opioid volume and 40% of total opioid prescriptions. Relative to their lower-risk counterparts, they wrote sixteen times more monthly opioid prescriptions (79 vs. 5, p < 0.01), and had more prescription-filling patients receiving opioids (47% vs. 19%, p < 0.01).

Developed for persons who used heroin and other opioids non-medically, RTSH is based on the idea that, regardless of a person's original reasons for using substances, substance use disorders stem from conditioning due to the reinforcing effects of repeated substance use. RTSH is designed to prevent relapse to opioid use and opioid use disorder by teaching and supporting alternative responses to stimuli previously associated with opioid use. The program, conducted in groups, combines cognitivebehavioral, social support, and lifestyle change approaches.
Program components were designed to address the clinical concerns of persons with opioid use disorder. The four main components of the RTSH program include recovery training sessions, support group meetings, weekend activities, and a support network. One study was reviewed for the RTSH program. The program was evaluated as promising for reducing criminal and delinquent behavior and opioid use and opioid use disorder on July 25, 2017. The review of the program yielded sufficient evidence of a favorable effect. Based on one study and one measure, the effect size for criminal and delinquent behavior is .43 (95% CI: .04, .82).

The fatal overdose rate in this area decreased by 35.0% after the opening of the SIF, from 253.8 to 165.1 deaths per 100,000 person-years (p=0.48). By contrast, during the same period, the fatal overdose rate in the rest of the city decreased by only 9.3%, from 7.6 to 6.9 deaths per 100,000 person-years (p=0.0490). There was a significant interaction of rate differences across strata (p=0.049). Interpretation: SIFs should be considered where injection drug use is prevalent, particularly in areas with high densities of overdose.""

In this cross-sectional study, we reviewed the records of the BCTHN administrative program to report on program outcomes (participation and overdose reversals). Focus groups and individual interviews were conducted with 40 clients in Vancouver, 12 individual interviews were completed with service providers, police officers and parents of people who use opioids from both the Vancouver and interior regions of British Columbia. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis and a qualitative descriptive approach. As of March 13, 2014, the BCTHN program had been implemented at 40 sites, trained 1318 participants in overdose prevention, recognition and response, distributed 836 kits to clients and received reports of 85 overdose reversals. Stakeholders were supportive of the program, and clients reported greater confidence in response to overdose. Service providers found the program training materials easy to use and that training increased client engagement. Some of the challenges included difficulty in identifying physician willing to prescribe, recruitment of some at-risk populations (e.g., long-term opioid users and patients with chronic pain), and clients' reluctance to call 911. We also found that the police had some misconceptions about BCTHN.

And lastly, by the end of high school, students will be taught skills needed to recognize the signs and symptoms of drug misuse, dependence, addictive behaviors and how to apply appropriate strategies to intervene and help a friend or family member. It also requires public schools to stock the overdose-reversal drug naloxone, have staff who are trained to use it and to report naloxone uses to the state.

Interrupted time series analysis of opioid related overdose death and acute care utilization rates from 2002 to 2009 comparing community-year strata with high and low rates of OEND implementation to those with no implementation. Nineteen Massachusetts communities (geographically distinct cities and towns) with at least five fatal opioid overdoses in each of the years 2004 to 2006. OEND was implemented among opioid users at risk for overdose, social service agency staff, family, and friends of opioid users. OEND programs equipped people at risk for overdose and bystanders with nasal naloxone rescue kits and trained them how to prevent, recognize, and respond to an overdose by engaging emergency medical services, providing rescue breathing, and delivering naloxone. The main outcome measures were adjusted rate ratios for annual deaths related to opioid overdose and utilization of acute care hospitals. Among these communities, OEND programs trained 2912 potential bystanders who reported 327 rescues.

These positive findings, initially demonstrated with individuals with cocaine use disorders, have been reproduced in individuals with alcohol, opioid, and methamphetamine use disorders. ---------------


Substance use disorders (SUDs) represent a highly prevalent and costly public health problem in the United States and most other developed and developing countries. Indeed, almost one-fifth (18%) of the U.S. population will experience an SUD at some point in their lifetime and the associated economic burden in terms of lost productivity and increased morbidity and mortality is estimated at $5 billion or more annually (Galanter & Kleber, 2008). The need for greater scientific understanding of SUDs as well as effective interventions for preventing and treating these disorders is tremendous. The field of behavior analysis has made numerous contributions to a scientific analysis of SUDs. Among those contributions is the use of contingency management (CM) to treat SUDs (Higgins, Silverman, & Heil, 2008), which is the focus of this chapter. CM involves the systeMedication Assisted Treatmentic application of reinforcing or punishing consequences to promote and sustain behavior change. When used in the treatment of SUDs, CM interventions usually focus not only on increasing abstinence from drug use, but also on increasing clinic attendance, adherence with medication regimens, and other therapeutic targets such as vocational goals (see Higgins et al., 2008). CM is typically used as part of a more comprehensive treatment intervention for SUDs, but it has also been used as an effective stand-alone treatment, depending on the particular type of SUD and population. CM treatments for SUDs have taken different forms over the approxiMedication Assisted Treatmentely 40 years in which they have appeared in the scientific literature, including, for example, earning clinic privileges contingent on objectively verified drug abstinence among methadone maintenance patients (e.g., Stitzer, Iguchi, & Felch, 1992), forfeiting a professional license contingent on drug use among drug-dependent health care workers (e.g., Crowley, 1985â1986), earning temporary housing among homeless drug-dependent individuals contingent on abstinence from drug use (e.g., Milby, Schumacher, Wallace, Freedmen, & Vuchinich, 2005), and earning vouchers exchangeable for retail items contingent on abstinence from drug use among individuals dependent on cocaine and other drugs (e.g., Higgins et al.,1991).

92,Lessons Learned from Naloxone Training and Distribution Programs in NYC,Layperson Training in Administration of Naloxone,"Abstract: ""Fatal heroin overdose is a significant cause of mortality for injection drug users (IDUs). Many of these deaths are preventable because opiate overdoses can be quickly and safely reversed through the injection of Naloxone [brand name Narcan], a prescription drug used to revive persons who have overdosed on heroin or other opioids. Currently, in several cities in the United States, drug users are being trained in naloxone administration and given naloxone for immediate and successful reversals of opiate overdoses. There has been very little formal description of the challenges faced in the development and implementation of large-scale IDU naloxone administration training and distribution programs and the lessons learned during this process. During a one year period, over 1,000 participants were trained in SKOOP (Skills and Knowledge on Opiate Prevention) and received a prescription for naloxone by a medical doctor on site at a syringe exchange program (SEP) in New York City. Participants in SKOOP were over the age of 18, current participants of SEPs, and current or former drug users. We present details about program design and lessons learned during the development and implementation of SKOOP. Lessons learned described in the manuscript are collectively articulated by the evaluators and implementers of the project.

(Piper et al., 2007)","Abstract: ""Fatal heroin overdose is a significant cause of mortality for injection drug users (IDUs). Many of these deaths are preventable because opiate overdoses can be quickly and safely reversed through the injection of Naloxone [brand name Narcan], a prescription drug used to revive persons who have overdosed on heroin or other opioids. Currently, in several cities in the United States, drug users are being trained in naloxone administration and given naloxone for immediate and successful reversals of opiate overdoses. There has been very little formal description of the challenges faced in the development and implementation of large-scale IDU naloxone administration training and distribution programs and the lessons learned during this process. During a one year period, over 1,000 participants were trained in SKOOP (Skills and Knowledge on Opiate Prevention) and received a prescription for naloxone by a medical doctor on site at a syringe exchange program (SEP) in New York City. Participants in SKOOP were over the age of 18, current participants of SEPs, and current or former drug users. We present details about program design and lessons learned during the development and implementation of SKOOP. Lessons learned described in the manuscript are collectively articulated by the evaluators and implementers of the project.

94,Prize Incentive Contingency Management (NREPP Endorsement),Contingency Management,"Prize Incentives Contingency Management for Substance Abuse is a variation of contingency management, or reinforcement, that awards prizes for abstinence and treatment compliance, such as group attendance and healthy behaviors. The program augments existing, usual care services in community-based treatment settings for adults who primarily abuse stimulants (especially cocaine) or opioids (especially heroin) or who have multiple substance use problems. Over a period of 3 months, urine and breath samples are collected two or three times a week for at least the first 6 weeks and once or twice weekly thereafter. For each sample that tests negative for the target drug, clients can draw slips of paper or plastic chips from a bowl for the chance of winning a prize valued from $1 to $100. Clients may also receive draws from the prize bowl for attending counseling/group therapy sessions and completing weekly activities designed to meet goals related to health (e.g., scheduling or attending a medical or nutritionist appointment, obtaining medications, recording daily medication or food consumption, exercising at a gym), sobriety (e.g., attending 12-step meetings), employment (e.g., creating a resume), and other areas. The number of draws from the prize bowl increases from 1 to as many as 15 with consecutive negative test results and/or attendance at consecutive sessions. A drug-positive sample or an unexcused absence resets the number of draws to one. Bonus draws may be awarded to clients on a predetermined schedule.

Setting: New Mexico had the second highest drug overdose death rate in 2014 of which 53% were related to prescription opioids. Opioid overdose death is preventable through the use of naloxone, a safe and effective medication that reverses the effects of prescription opioids and heroin. Pharmacists can play an important role in providing naloxone to individuals who use prescription opioids. Interventions: A multifaceted approach was utilized in New Mexico from the top down with legislative passage of provisions for a statewide standing order and New Mexico Department of Health support for pharmacy-based naloxone delivery. A bottom up approach was also initiated with the development and implementation of a training program for pharmacists and pharmacy technicians. Evaluation: Naloxone Medicaid claims were used to illustrate statewide distribution and utilization of the pharmacist statewide standing order for naloxone. Percent of pharmacies dispensing naloxone in each county were calculated. Trained pharmacy staff completed a program evaluation form. Questions about quality of instruction and ability of trainer to meet stated objectives were rated on a Likert scale. Results: There were 808 naloxone Medicaid claims from 100 outpatient pharmacies during the first half of 2016, a 9-fold increase over 2014.

Descriptive statistics were performed for main outcome variables, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the participants’ two questionnaire scores from pre-and post-training. Participating inmates (n = 31) were found to have a high baseline knowledge of risk factors, symptoms, and care regarding opioid overdoses.

We administered four instruments, assessing comfort and knowledge around opioid overdose and naloxone administration, to opioid users receiving naloxone for the first time (N = 60) and upon returning for a refill (N = 54) at community distribution programs. Participants completed the instruments prior to receiving naloxone; first-time recipients repeated the instruments immediately after the standardized 5–10 min education. Comfort with recognition of, response to, and administration of naloxone for an overdose event significantly increased after brief education among first-time recipients (p < 0.05). Knowledge of appropriate responses to opioid overdose was high across all assessments; 96% of participants could identify at least one acceptable action to assess and one acceptable action to care for an opioid overdose. Facility with naloxone administration was high across all assessments and significantly increased for intranasal administration after education for first-time recipients (p < 0.001). First-time recipients (before and after education) and refillers demonstrated a high level of knowledge on the Brief Overdose Recognition and Response Assessment, correctly identifying a mean of 13.7 out of 16 overdose scenarios. Opioid users seeking naloxone in San Francisco have a high level of baseline knowledge around recognizing and responding to opioid overdose and those returning for refills retain that knowledge.

109,Co-Locating Naloxone with Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs),Community Distribution of Naloxone,"Abstract: ""Introduction: Opioid-related overdoses have been steadily increasing over the past decade in the United States. Naloxone is used by first responders to revive overdose victims, but results may be improved by increasing access to and usage of naloxone by bystanders. Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) are pervasive, recognizable, and publicly accessible. Co-locating naloxone kits with AEDs could increase public naloxone access and usage. However, the impact of co-locating naloxone kits with AEDs is not known. Objectives: We sought to evaluate the impact of co-locating naloxone kits with AEDs in a simulation study centered on Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Methods: Naloxone administration frequency (N = 3,650) at the zip-code level from March 2016 to March 2017 was provided by the Allegheny County Health Department. AED point locations (N = 1,653) were obtained from the University of Pittsburgh's Resuscitation Logistics and Informatics Venture. Zip-code level geospatial analyses were conducted using QGIS and STATA to determine the correlation between AED count and naloxone administrations. AED naloxone kit (N-AED) coverage, based on a maximum “walking-distance” radius of 200 m, was estimated at a zip-code level using the QGIS buffer tool and a custom MATLAB script. Potential impact of N-AEDs was estimated assuming uniform spatial distribution of naloxone administrations. Results: The median (IQR) AED coverage based on a 200 m access radius per zip code was 4% (0–7). The median (IQR) number of naloxone administrations per zip code was 27(7-55). A total of 82 zip codes had data for both AED locations and naloxone administrations. The correlation between number of AEDs and naloxone administrations per zip code was 0.20. Overall, 16% of naloxone administrations were estimated to be covered by an N-AED. Conclusion: Using these limited methods, co-locating naloxone with AEDs is not likely to have a standalone impact on preventing overdose fatalities.""","Abstract: ""Introduction: Opioid-related overdoses have been steadily increasing over the past decade in the United States.

Participants: The target population is people who use opioids by any route, throughout the City of Toronto. Setting: The POINT program is operated by the needle exchange program at Toronto Public Health (The Works) and offered at over 40 partner agency sites throughout Toronto. Intervention: POINT is a comprehensive program of overdose prevention and response training, including naloxone dispensing. Clients are instructed by public health staff on overdose risk factors, recognizing signs and symptoms of overdose, calling 911, naloxone administration, stimulation and chest compressions, and post-overdose care. Training is offered to clients one-on-one or in small groups. Clients receive a naloxone kit including two 1 mL ampoules of naloxone hydrochloride (0.4 mg/mL) and are advised to return to The Works for a refill and debriefing if the naloxone kit is used. Outcomes: In the first 8 months of the program, 209 clients were trained. Clients have reported 17 administrations of naloxone, and all overdose victims have reportedly survived. Client demand for POINT training has been high, and Toronto Public Health has expanded its capacity to provide training. Overall, reception to the program has been overwhelmingly positive.

Evidence of long-term efficacy of opioids for chronic pain is limited. Opioid use is associated with serious risks, including opioid use disorder and overdose. Objective: To provide recommendations about opioid prescribing for primary care clinicians treating adult patients with chronic pain outside of active cancer treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care. Process: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated a 2014 systematic review on effectiveness and risks of opioids and conducted a supplemental review on benefits and harms, values and preferences, and costs. CDC used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework to assess evidence type and determine the recommendation category. Evidence Synthesis: Evidence consisted of observational studies or randomized clinical trials with notable limitations, characterized as low quality using GRADE methodology. Meta-analysis was not attempted due to the limited number of studies, variability in study designs and clinical heterogeneity, and methodological shortcomings of studies. No study evaluated long-term (≥1 year) benefit of opioids for chronic pain. Opioids were associated with increased risks, including opioid use disorder, overdose, and death, with dose-dependent effects. Recommendations: There are 12 recommendations. Of primary importance, nonopioid therapy is preferred for treatment of chronic pain. Opioids should be used only when benefits for pain and function are expected to outweigh risks. Before starting opioids, clinicians should establish treatment goals with patients and consider how opioids will be discontinued if benefits do not outweigh risks. When opioids are used, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effective dosage, carefully reassess benefits and risks when considering increasing dosage to 50 morphine milligram equivalents or more per day, and avoid concurrent opioids and benzodiazepines whenever possible. Clinicians should evaluate benefits and harms of continued opioid therapy with patients every 3 months or more frequently and review prescription drug monitoring program data, when available, for high-risk combinations or dosages. For patients with opioid use disorder, clinicians should offer or arrange evidence-based treatment, such as medication-assisted treatment with buprenorphine or methadone. Conclusions and Relevance: The guideline is intended to improve communication about benefits and risks of opioids for chronic pain, improve safety and effectiveness of pain treatment, and reduce risks associated with long-term opioid therapy.""","Abstract: ""Primary care clinicians find managing chronic pain challenging.

Methods: Four focus groups were conducted between December 2014 and February 2015 with 21 patients trained in OEND. Participants were recruited from a VA residential facility in California with a substance use disorder treatment program (mandatory OEND training) and a homeless program (optional OEND training). Data were analyzed using matrices and open and closed coding approaches to identify participants' perspectives on OEND training including benefits, concerns, differing opinions, and suggestions for improvement. Results: Veterans thought OEND training was interesting, novel, and empowering, and that naloxone kits will save lives. Some veterans expressed concern about using syringes in the kits. A few patients who never used opioids were not interested in receiving kits. Veterans had differing opinions about legal and liability issues, whether naloxone kits might contribute to relapse, and whether and how to involve family in training.

132,Project Lazarus: Naloxone Distribution in North Carolina,Community Distribution of Naloxone,"Abstract: ""Background: In response to some of the highest drug overdose death rates in the country, Project Lazarus developed a community‐based overdose prevention program in Western North Carolina. The Wilkes County unintentional poisoning mortality rate was quadruple that of the state's in 2009 and due almost exclusively to prescription opioid pain relievers, including fentanyl, hydrocodone, methadone, and oxycodone. The program is ongoing. Methods: The overdose prevention program involves five components: community activation and coalition building; monitoring and surveillance data; prevention of overdoses; use of rescue medication for reversing overdoses by community members; and evaluating project components. Principal efforts include education of primary care providers in managing chronic pain and safe opioid prescribing, largely through the creation of a tool kit and face‐to‐face meetings. Results: Preliminary unadjusted data for Wilkes County revealed that the overdose death rate dropped from 46.6 per 100,000 in 2009 to 29.0 per 100,000 in 2010. There was a decrease in the number of victims who received prescriptions for the substance implicated in their fatal overdose from a Wilkes County physician; in 2008, 82% of overdose decedents received a prescription for an opioid analgesic from a Wilkes prescriber compared with 10% in 2010. Conclusions: While the results from this community‐based program are preliminary, the number and nature of prescription opioid overdose deaths in Wilkes County changed during the intervention.

This study evaluated public response to a social marketing campaign promoting a community-based drug take-back program, the American Medicine Chest Challenge. Method: A telephone survey was conducted with a representative sample of adults in New Jersey (N = 906) 2 weeks following the conclusion of the statewide collection day event in November 2010. The survey assessed public exposure to the campaign and the extent to which it is associated with public perceptions and behaviors the campaign was designed to influence. Results: The campaign, which relied heavily on community channels for the dissemination of messages, was able to reach directly more than 60% of its target audience. When potential confounders were controlled for, campaign exposure was a strong predictor of a respondent having one or more conversations with others about medicine disposal (odds ratio [OR] = 2.4, 95% CI [1.5, 3.6]); actually disposing of expired, unwanted, or unused medicine in a collection site (OR = 2.14, 95% CI [1.15, 3.9]); and talking to kids about the dangers of prescription drug abuse (OR = 1.65, 95% CI [1.1, 2.45])—all of which were exclusively promoted through the campaign.

Medicaid Lock-In Programs (MLIPs) are designed to prevent over-utilization of controlled substances by Medicaid patients. However, despite widespread use, there is little information on their effect. Using North Carolina (NC) Medicaid claims data from October 2008 through June 2013, we examined changes in Medicaid-reimbursed opioid prescriptions by patients enrolled in NC's MLIP. We used mixed effects models to examine the effect of MLIP enrollment on monthly opioid claims, number of pharmacies, total days' supply, total units (ie, pills), and total Medicaid payments for opioids. In our sample of 6,148 MLIP patients, the odds of having any opioid claim in a given month was 84% lower during MLIP enrollment relative to the period before enrollment (odds ratio = .16). MLIP enrollment also corresponded with a reduction in monthly number of opioid prescriptions by 1.13, monthly number of pharmacies by .61, and monthly Medicaid expenditures by $22.78. Although MLIPs may constitute a successful component of comprehensive efforts to reduce the potential over-utilization of opioids, care should be taken to ensure that programs such as MLIPs do not constrain patients' legitimate needs for analgesic medications.""","Abstract: ""Opioid misuse, abuse, and overdose are a rapidly growing public health epidemic.

Results indicate improvement among youths in all three treatments, with MDFT showing superior improvement overall. MDFT participants also demonstrated change at the 1-year follow-up period in the important prosocial factors of school/academic performance and family functioning as measured by behavioral ratings.

The study also provides specific insight into the interactive effects of therapist model specific adherence and measures of youth risk and protective factors on behavioral outcomes for a diverse group of adolescents. The findings suggest that FFT was effective in reducing youth behavioral problems, although only when the therapists adhered to the treatment model. High adherent therapists delivering FFT had a statistically significant reduction of (35%) in felony, a (30%) violent crime, and a marginally significant reduction (21%) in misdemeanor recidivisms as compared to the control condition. The results represent a significant reduction in serious crimes one year after treatment, when delivered by a model adherent therapist. The low adherent therapists were significantly higher than the control group in recidivism rates. There was an interaction effect between youth risk level and therapist adherence demonstrating that the most difficult families (those with high peer and family risk) had a higher likelihood of successful outcomes when their therapist demonstrated model specific adherence. These results are discussed within the context of the need and importance of measuring and accounting for model specific adherence in the evaluation of community-based replications of evidence-based family therapy models like FFT.""","Abstract: ""The study examined the effectiveness of Functional Family Therapy (FFT), as compared to probation services, in a community juvenile justice setting 12 months post treatment.

High adherent therapists delivering FFT had a statistically significant reduction of (35%) in felony, a (30%) violent crime, and a marginally significant reduction (21%) in misdemeanor recidivisms as compared to the control condition. The results represent a significant reduction in serious crimes one year after treatment, when delivered by a model adherent therapist. The low adherent therapists were significantly higher than the control group in recidivism rates. There was an interaction effect between youth risk level and therapist adherence demonstrating that the most difficult families (those with high peer and family risk) had a higher likelihood of successful outcomes when their therapist demonstrated model specific adherence. These results are discussed within the context of the need and importance of measuring and accounting for model specific adherence in the evaluation of community-based replications of evidence-based family therapy models like FFT.""",http://dx.doi.org/doi.org/10.1037/a0019406,"Sexton, T., & Turner, C.

179,An Outcome-based Evaluation of Functional Family Therapy for Youth with Behavioral Problems,Family Functional Therapy,"Abstract: ""This article presents results of an evaluation of Functional Family Therapy (FFT), an intervention implemented to address the behavioral problems of at-risk youth in the state of New Jersey. FFT is a model clinical family intervention designed to assist adolescents and their families in preventing further delinquency and violent behavior by enhancing support and communication within the family. We employed a pre-post comparison group design to compare intervention outcomes for youth who received FFT with matched youth who received individual therapy or mentoring. The dependent variable was a change in the risk and protective factors for both youth and their parents, as derived from the Strengths and Needs Assessment (SNA) tool. Although the analysis reveals significant positive improvements in a few domains for both the treatment and the comparison group, only youth who received FFT exhibited a significant reduction in emotional and behavioral needs and risk behaviors. The effectiveness of the intervention may vary by gender, race, age, and ethnicity.

204,Prize Reinforcement Contingency Management for Cocaine Dependence: Integration With Group Therapy in a Methadone Clinic,Contingency Management,"Abstract
""In this study, the authors evaluated a low-cost contingency management (CM) procedure for reducing cocaine use and enhancing group therapy attendance in 77 cocaine-dependent methadone patients. Patients were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of standard treatment or standard treatment with CM, in which patients earned the opportunity to win prizes ranging from $1 to $100 for submitting cocainenegative samples and attending therapy. Patients in the CM condition submitted more cocaine-negative samples and attended more groups than patients in standard treatment. The best predictor of cocaine abstinence at follow-up was duration of abstinence during treatment. On average, patients in the CM condition earned $117 in prizes. Data from this study suggest that some aspects of reinforcement can be implemented in group therapy in community-based clinics.""","Abstract

205, Randomized Trial of Contingent Prizes Versus Vouchers in Cocaine-Using Methadone Patients,Contingency Management,"Abstract: ""Contingency management (CM) interventions frequently utilize vouchers as reinforcers, but a prize- based system is also efficacious. This study compared these approaches. Seventy-four cocaine-dependent methadone outpatients were randomly assigned to standard treatment (ST), ST plus a maximum of $585 in contingent vouchers, or ST plus an expected average maximum of $300 in contingent prizes for 12 weeks. CM participants achieved longer durations of abstinence (LDA) than ST participants, and CM conditions did not differ significantly in outcomes or amount of reinforcement earned.

221,Office-Based Treatment of Opiate Addiction with a Sublingual-Tablet Formulation of Buprenorphine and Naloxone,Pharmacotherapy Related Programs & Policies,"Abstract: ""Office-based treatment of opiate addiction with a sublingual-tablet formulation of buprenorphine and naloxone has been proposed, but its efficacy and safety have not been well studied. We conducted a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving 326 opiate-addicted persons who were assigned to office-based treatment with sublingual tablets consisting of buprenorphine (16 mg) in combination with naloxone (4 mg), buprenorphine alone (16 mg), or placebo given daily for four weeks. The primary outcome measures were the percentage of urine samples negative for opiates and the subjects' self-reported craving for opiates. Safety data were obtained on 461 opiate-addicted persons who participated in an open-label study of buprenorphine and naloxone (at daily doses of up to 24 mg and 6 mg, respectively) and another 11 persons who received this combination only during the trial. The double-blind trial was terminated early because buprenorphine and naloxone in combination and buprenorphine alone were found to have greater efficacy than placebo. The proportion of urine samples that were negative for opiates was greater in the combined-treatment and buprenorphine groups (17.8 percent and 20.7 percent, respectively) than in the placebo group (5.8 percent, P<0.001 for both comparisons); the active-treatment groups also reported less opiate craving (P<0.001 for both comparisons with placebo). Rates of adverse events were similar in the active-treatment and placebo groups. During the open-label phase, the percentage of urine samples negative for opiates ranged from 35.2 percent to 67.4 percent. Results from the open-label follow-up study indicated that the combined treatment was safe and well tolerated.

Substance-use and mental-health outcomes and health care utilization in the first year following treatment entry were compared between patients with and without a diagnosis of PTSD. Results: Patients with and without PTSD had similar treatment responses. Although patients with PTSD had longer histories of drug use at intake, at 1-year follow-up they showed reductions in heroin, cocaine, and alcohol use, comparable to patients without the disorder. PTSD patients received higher doses of opiate medication, attended more psychosocial treatment sessions for substance-use disorder, and had better treatment retention. Psychiatric symptoms for patients with PTSD were more severe at intake and showed little improvement throughout treatment.

241,The Children and Recovering Mothers (CHARM) Collaborative ,Other,"The Children and Recovering Mothers (CHARM) Collaborative in Burlington, Vermont, is a multidisciplinary group of ten agencies that collectively serve women with opioid addiction and their families during pregnancy and infancy.  Members of the CHARM Collaborative meet once a month for two hours to discuss the needs of client families and how to address these needs. Decisions about solutions and follow‐up tasks are made for each family before the next family is discussed. Typically, about 40 families are discussed at each meeting. The CHARM process avoids problems resulting from conflicting information about patient health, progress in recovery, and behavior. The benefits of CHARM to families include healthier pregnancies, healthier babies, and a greater chance to remain together or be reunified. Since CHARM began, access to MAT for pregnant women has increased, and women are receiving treatment earlier in their pregnancies. There is a trend toward increased birth weight, and fewer babies require pharmacological treatment for withdrawal symptoms after discharge from the hospital. Some babies requiring treatment after discharge are able to complete that treatment at home. The linked report describes and examines two aspects of the CHARM Collaborative: 1) the multiple points of intervention for families and 2) the collaborative practice elements across systems (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2016).","The Children and Recovering Mothers (CHARM) Collaborative in Burlington, Vermont, is a multidisciplinary group of ten agencies that collectively serve women with opioid addiction and their families during pregnancy and infancy.

258,Using Technology Assisted Care Coordination to Reduce Opioid Abuse and Treatment Costs,Tele-Health,"Abstract: ""A small study was conducted to pilot the use of an automated text messaging and phone call system to monitor patient opioid use behaviors and to reduce treatment costs.  The Technology Assisted Care Coordination (TACC) was developed to provide automated text messaging and phone call for patients receiving treatment for opioid addiction.  Twenty-one patients at Preferred Family Healthcare, a non-profit organization in Missouri, began using the services in early 2017.  Through text messages patients were asked about their opioid use behaviors within the last day or their urge to use.  Patients were also offered a ""panic button"" option for high-risk situations. Patients that report difficulty with managing their use or urge behaviors were asked follow-up questions which helped identify high risk patient.  Care providers were immediately notified of high risk patients and intervened via phone call or in-person appointment, however appropriate. Data was collected through the text messaging service to monitor opioid usage behaviors.  At the time of enrollment, 42% of patients reported substance use in the past 3 days, 41% report no use, and the remainder didn't respond. After 3 months,  substance use declined.
